            <h3>Order Cancellation</h3>
            <p>

            <ul>
              <li>Goods availability</li>

              <li>Errors in Your Order</li>
            </ul>

              We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order if fraud or an
              unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
            </p>
            <h4>Your Order Cancellation Rights</h4>
            <p>
              Any Goods you purchase can only be returned in accordance with
              these Terms and Conditions and Our Returns Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Returns Policy forms a part of these Terms and Conditions.
              Please read our Returns Policy to learn more about your right to
              cancel Your Order.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your right to cancel an Order only applies to Goods that are
              returned in the same condition as You received them. You should
              also include all of the product's instructions, documents and
              wrappings. Goods that are damaged or not in the same condition as
              You received them or which are worn simply beyond opening the
              original packaging will not be refunded. You should therefore take
              reasonable care of the purchased Goods while they are in Your
              possession.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day on which
              We receive the returned Goods. We will use the same means of
              payment as You used for the Order, and You will not incur any fees
              for such reimbursement.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will not have any right to cancel an Order for the supply of
              any of the following Goods:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly
                personalized.
              </li>
              <li>
                The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not
                suitable to be returned, deteriorate rapidly or where the date
                of expiry is over.
              </li>
              <li>
                The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to
                health protection or hygiene reasons and were unsealed after
                delivery.
              </li>
              <li>
                The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to
                their nature, inseparably mixed with other items.
              </li>
              <li>
                The supply of digital content which is not supplied on a
                tangible medium if the performance has begun with Your prior
                express consent and You have acknowledged Your loss of
                cancellation right.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h3>
            <p>
              We are constantly updating Our offerings of Goods on the Service.
              The Goods available on Our Service may be mispriced, described
              inaccurately, or unavailable, and We may experience delays in
              updating information regarding our Goods on the Service and in Our
              advertising on other websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any
              information, including prices, product images, specifications,
              availability, and services. We reserve the right to change or
              update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or
              omissions at any time without prior notice.
            </p>
            <h3>Prices Policy</h3>
            <p>
              The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time
              prior to accepting an Order.
            </p>
            <p>
              The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to
              accepting an Order in the event of any occurrence affecting
              delivery caused by government action, variation in customs duties,
              increased shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs and any
              other matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You
              will have the right to cancel Your Order.
            </p>
            <h3>Payments</h3>
            <p>
              All Goods purchased are subject to a one-time payment. Payment can
              be made through various payment methods we have available, such as
              Visa, MasterCard, Affinity Card, American Express cards or online
              payment methods (PayPal, for example).
            </p>
            <p>
              Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to
              validation checks and authorization by Your card issuer. If we do
              not receive the required authorization, We will not be liable for
              any delay or non-delivery of Your Order.
            </p>
            <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
            <h3>Subscription period</h3>
            <p>
              The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a
              paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring
              and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually),
              depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when
              purchasing the Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically
              renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the
              Company cancels it.
            </p>
            <h3>Subscription cancellations</h3>
            <p>
              You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your
              Account settings page or by contacting the Company. You will not
              receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your current
              Subscription period and You will be able to access the Service
              until the end of Your current Subscription period.
            </p>
            <h3>Billing</h3>
            <p>
              You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing
              information including full name, address, state, zip code,
              telephone number, and a valid payment method.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company
              will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
              manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
              corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
            </p>
            <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
            <p>
              The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
              the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become
              effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any
              change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to
              terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee
              change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the
              modified Subscription fee amount.
            </p>
            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            <p>
              Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are
              non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

              provision of these Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the

              through the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
              shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special,
              incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
              (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss
              of data or other information, for business interruption, for

              limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
              which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
              these states, each party's liability will be limited to the
              greatest extent permitted by law.
            </p>
